In the artificial intelligence world, we have a specific phrase that highlights the nature that are robot overlords will have over power, referenced frequently by Ben Goertzal: “The AI doesn’t hate you, they don’t love you. But they will use your atoms for something else”. Interestingly, this also mirrors the behaviour of which corporations behave.

I wrap this around with cancel culture; corporations are not left-wing, and they are not right-wing; but they will misappropriate your social cause in order to make them the most money. This is why we should be inherently suspicious of any movement that begins at the top rungs of society, because they will use a left wing or right wing idealogy. They will even use radical centrist idealogies. This is because corporations do not have a set moral code.

And what seems to have been happening, cancel culture is being weaponized by both sides of the political divide. This makes an inherently difficult problem to address socially, because we really don’t know what the inherent politics of this systemic issue is. This is why it is such a trouble think purely in left wing / right wing politics, because if per chance something uses both idealogical slants to further their aims, we don’t know how to deal with the problem.

What is interesting is that this side of cancel culture has been happening along with the recent UFO investigations that have been happening in Washington. If anything could be described as a state-run corporation, that would be Washington DC. This is why it is perfectly in character for Washington to take advantage of our political division, because Washington does not have a specific moral code, they use anything that gives them the most power.

This is why, before the Singularity happens, we need to resolve our political divisions, and try to work together to further the goals of peace. And not give in to social divisions. And be suspicious of any large-scale enterprise that wants to further the whims of cancel culture.
