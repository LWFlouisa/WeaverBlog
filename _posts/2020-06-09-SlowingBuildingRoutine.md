Slowly getting back into the swing of writing, although Twitter has been making that sort of thing difficult latelly. The main thing is that it is almost impossible to focus on anything. Mastodon is marketing itself as an alternative to Twitter, but honestly you have a lot of the same culture of Mastodon that made Twitter fail for the vast majority of people that have normal political and social viewpoints.

There was a time when I would have actually jumped on the opprotunity to join the political side of Twitter, but what has become apparent is that most of the people there are clout chasers, and even those who call themselves Authors are also grifters, and close friends with people that are.

There is this girl I’ve known on Absolute Writers Water Color that has some issue with me I haven’t figured out. When I’m in a better mental headspace, I might ask her what her issue is. She is a really interesting blogger, and has a detailed break down of different science fiction genres. What genre I wrote used to matter to me a whole lot more, but now I kind of just want to get a story written. Even if that story is Dystopian.

Oddly leaving Twitter has been much harder than leaving Youtube, despite the fact that I spend most of the time on Youtube, mostly listening to music these days. It turns out Desgarrada is the name of a genre of Portuguese Fairy Tale music, roughly equivalent to Gritty Folk Rock in the US. There is also considerable cross-over from Desgarrada, Pimba, and Fado. Frequently Portuguese musicians have tried their hand at playing all three.

But these days I would be happy just getting one thousand words finished, let alone 17,500 words like I used to churn out back when I wrote my first nine novellas / novelettes. Although I’m considering not using Wattpad-like platforms, or perhaps using them sparingly, and specifically not Wattpad. Writer’s Cafe and Honeyfeed are very good for that genre of website.

For the foreseeable future I think it will be more practical work on Graphic Novels rather than prose, at least while I’m still living with my parents. I also need to think about distancing myself from both Gender Abolitionists and Gender Critical portions of social media. As my views on trans issues really is somewhere in the middle:

-- There is a biological basis for gender.
-- However, trans women should be able to use women’s restrooms.

On Twitter in particular, it’s almost impossible to make this point, but so many people are so caught up in the extremes. Just to clarify, I do not mean Syreyne Talks in this context, she has actually been quite reasonable in these last few months. But those more extreme than either of us are genuinely ruining my Twitter experience, as I mostly just want to live my life as a trans woman. Even if that means becoming a lady in waiting to finance my transition. It seems like there are safe ways to go about it.

But right now it just feels like my life isn’t moving forward, so all I have right now is to write flash fiction and webcomics.
