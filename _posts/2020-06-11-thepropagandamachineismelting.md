title: The Propaganda Machine Is Melting

It is well known in the UFO community that propaganda has been used in the past to make people submissive to the oppressions in the American regime. Additionally, I consider Marvel and DC to be one limb in a larger cogwork of propaganda outlets in bed with the matrix. But with the publishing of the Harper’s Letter, along with the widespread cancelling of prominent UFO creators, along with the release of UFO information by Luis Elizondo, what seems to be becoming increasingly apparent is how the old propaganda machine is malfunctioning, and that people across the politics spectrum of noticing this in mass.

I still remember when UFOs were largely an obscure topic, and that I was the weird one listening to people like Richard Hoagland and Richard Dolan, along with others in the UFO community. Recently Tom Delonge had been very big news in the UFO community for working with the intelligence community.

Additionally, Marvel and DC had been acting as outlets of propaganda long before the recent culture war between the very Far Left and very Far Right, and for this reason should be considered part of the systemic flaw of that industry, rather than a partisan dynamic.

The Harper’s letter came out at the same time as Bleeding Cool articles about the wide spread cancelling of prominent Comics Creators, and I can’t help but feel like something something is brewing in the AI Development and UFO research community as well. And that is why they are all relatively touchy about being criticsed about issues.

To me this is highly suggestive, maybe even overt, that the old propaganda machine that made us believe things to get us into the Iraq War, and generations before that the Vietnam War, is falling apart before our us. This unnerves me, because to me it indicates just how fragile American society is. And that more than a culture war, perhaps this schism was mostly thinly tapered over in the past, and that it had always been the case.

America isn’t becoming a country in name only, it had always been only a country in name only. And we are know peeling away the illussions otherwise.
