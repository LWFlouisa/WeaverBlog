[Why Youtube Events Are Toxic For Your Brand](https://video.ploud.jp/videos/embed/bc44b4be-e77a-4d08-80ad-a30b36a2fd89)
 
One of the issues I ran across on Twitter specifically, some of the publishers on there have an extremely narrow idea of what marketing is. Social media is not the same thing as television advertisement; there isn’t a limited number of things you can talk about to maintain your brand. Throw away everything you know about Legacy Branding, get that out the window.

In social media, you talk about everything besides your work and other people comics and merchandize. It is literally disastrous to talk about the things that you are trying to sell. Considering that I have an interest in other things besides comics, specifically creative writing and artificial intelligence, if I can’t talk about those things, then what else do I have to talk about?

Yes, sometimes I’m going to have political views that you’re going to disagree with, pretending like that doesn’t exist is not going to be make that problem go away. You better just suck up and deal with that reality, as most people--and creators are no exception to this, have other things going on their lives besides wanting to promote their comic.

But I have seen this pattern in the Independant Publishing community before, specifically when New Adult LitChat was still running on Twitter. They were such a narrow about things that you could talk about, such a narrow about things that you could do as an independant author, that it defeated the entire purpose of being an independant author.

And guess what, that Chatroom dissolved extremely quickly. One of the guys are not producing pornography screenplays, because nobody else wanting to talk about writing with him. Youtube more generally seems to have an influx of people that genuinely do not understand branding, and how branding is different on social media, especially when marketing to Free Software people.

You’re not going to improve that situation, but lecturing people for having different political viewpoints, or saying “if you’re not part of the solution, then shut up.”

Because guess what, you don’t seem to be part of the solution yourself. So why don’t you shut up? Oh right, because it’s power for you!
