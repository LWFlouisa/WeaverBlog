title: Trans Issues Are Real, However
published: true

People that can afford to dye their hair, and go back to living a normal life as a cis person or act like being a trans woman isn't real because it didn't work for them, genuinely have no idea the struggle actual trans people face. They have nothing to contribute about the conversation of privilege.

Meanwhile, I have no support group to go to IRL, because my ex president others voted for set me up with a chaser. 

I'm saying this as someone who is leftist, please leave your Class Reductionism and Consciousness ideology at the door. That's not what a support group for trans issues is for. It's for helping people find the medical resources people going the traditional route need.

But please, enlighten me about what "priviledge" is. Tell me, a minority, not to want trans faces on grocery store products. Why do you think most actual trans women and men drop out of politics? It's because of shit like this.

There are not people who misappropriate the struggles of others, who have experienced any oppression they haven't made for themselves.

Yes that's not a popular opinion, but it is true.
