title: Renfamous Doesn't Represent Comics Or Trans People

Let me tell you a thing or two about Renfamous. Bare in mind the trans community has had their share of boogiemen, whether that’s Jessica Yaniv or Renfamous. In both cases these tend to be generally bad images of trans people, while the rest of us have no intention of being activists in any shape or form. Politically, I am actually more left-wing than Renfamous is, but I frequently get smeared with the same brush that is Renfamous.

Note that we are both comic creators, however the difference is despite us both being left-wing, I have in the past had a more live and let live approach when it comes to tolerating people of differing viewpoints. This is how you get by in the world as insane as it is. I knew of Renfamous back when I was still involving myself in anarchist spaces, specifically wanting to study mutualism rather than anarcho-communism.

When PS was swatted, she had absolutely no sympathy for his situation. You would think if the shoe were on the other foot, she would expect other people to have sympathy for her if she experience the same issue PS did. And yet, what we have is people that dehumanize other people with different political viewpoints, rather than trying to educate. Note that being intimidating to others and trying to keep them out of the comic industry is not education in any sense.

It puts me in an isolated situation, because on one hand I still have left-wing viewpoints. And yet I also don’t want to associate with the mind fuck that seems to be happening on left-wing circles. Cancelling creator was not what I asked for as a leftist. Even as a leftist, I find Renfamous behavior absolutely deplorable. Most of the moderate left on Twitter is so preoccupied with discussing the J.K. Rowling cancellation, that we don’t even check the behavior of our own people like Renfamous, assuming she actually is even trans.

That’s kind of the thing, a lot of the people claiming to be trans, are not in fact actually trans people. They like the take tours around the idea of being trans, but at their core such people are not actually trans. And yet such people are allowed to give us a negative presentation about what we want in Comics.

I already have Renfamous herself blocked, I also blocked Tom King and Brian Michael Bendis. But canceling creators is not who I represent as a trans person. We need to, as trans people, to start speaking out against pretenders that ape our social status, and use it cause social harm like blocking people out of comics.
