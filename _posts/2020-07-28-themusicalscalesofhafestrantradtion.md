title: The Musical Scales Of Hafestran Tradition

I have a specific poetry rhythm in mind when I write pages of comic script, even though traditionally comic script isnâ€™t usually thought of as a form of poetry. My primary influences are Latin Music, Lusophone, Francophone, and Japanese music. I have even invented a specific musical scale for my current poetry:

This is reflected in the rhythm of the captions themselves, in which I follow my own personal syllabic rhythm when I write them: 8-6-6-8-4. The rhyme scheme is usually ABBCD, and sometimes ABBCB. This follows the rhythm of Hafestran music, which is a mixture of French and Japanese traditional music, with some modern dance overtones.

The setting of Uploaded Fairy is a Cyberpunk dystopia, so in this case it would be synthwave dance, specifically Dark Wave. However the same rhythms can also be found in the ethnic music left over from the two civil wars that ripped across the old American landscape: the music of Mexican immigrants, of Spanish and French people fleeing persecution as Romani, and a smidgen of Brazilian and Portuguese notes. The later portion, was brought over from Japan when the Army Of The Rising Sun, took over territory that was once controlled by the French forces.

The modern rhythm, comes from the song Yo Dorian Scale. Earlier versions of the music come from the revolutionary song They Left Behind Rice And Water. The instruments in traditional music usually involve a Flamenco guitar, a Ukelele, a Shamisen, hand claps, and other musical traditions.

The captions are suppose to flow sort of like singing. How far I will take this will depend on what my level of concentration is. Lately being able to see down and just write has given me a little bit of trouble. Those who have sensitivity to noise know what I mean.

Here is a clip from song in such scale:
