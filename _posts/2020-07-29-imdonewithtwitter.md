title: I'm Done With Twitter

People, please move to Mastodon. Twitter is a fucking sinking ship. You have people throwing mud on all sides of the political divide. I’m tired of feeling like I have to participate in this nonsense. Jack Dorsey is 100% responsible for this continuation. Each and every time I keep trying not to make a public statement about things, and Mr. Jack Dorsey’s platform feels like he has to drag me into fucking drama.

I’m done here. I’m not going to look at Twitter anymore. The people that still use that platform despite being encourage to not, and sinking their own ship. They are not worth saving. I keep trying to be nice about asking people not to drag me into their personal score settling. This has gotten to be absolutely exhausting. You even have Centrists, you know centrists, that talk about the value of nuance, fucking slinging mud at each other.

I feel like the state of the comics industry is symptomatic of a larger problem of the way that Twitter operates. Every day I look on the platform, I have to use some alternative account because some asshole has to make their side of the political isle my problem. When the problem is purely their own issue. I can’t even agree about some issue a right-winger has said, despite being left-wing myself, because agreeing on anything is seen as the left wing version of degenerate.

I’m going to start blocking people that keeps trying to fucking force to have a political stand about issue. I do not fucking owe you any public statement what so ever about my views. I don’t even know why Youtubers feel like they have to. They are playing in this game activists on both sides on playing.

Keep me out of the discussion with your childish squabbling. I’m not fucking interested. I want my life to some fucking normalcy for a change.
