title: Politics Is Not A Stand In For Social Issues

In general, the idea that people should avoid controversial topics comes from the right place, despite what some radical Leftists ( as suppose to Berniecrats ) may have you believe. However the problem with saying you should avoid the political, is that politics even without the excessively broad definition Leftist extremists apply, can mean a wide variety of potential topics to avoid discussing. Politics can mean everything from Economic issues, Social Issues, and issues related to how we relate to authority.

I have begun to feel like this ambiguity about what politics means, in the conversation of telling people to avoid certain subjects, is almost part of the design. In a sense, by limited people to producing comics about a very narrow variety of topics, one can avoid having things outsell someone, or be within a range that they can compete. In a sense, it is almost a form of “Social Protectionism”.

The intent of this kind of Social Protectionism, is to protect other writers who may not have as much knowledge about economics or social issues, and still allowing them to compete on the same level as informed creators. What is egregious is rather than trying to avoid nuance to this conversation, Twitter leftists have taken this regressive strain about basically run with it, and use it to imply that anyone that believes in a form of social protectionism is a kind of Right-Winger.

The problem is not so much with people that take people’s words for it ( although without a doubt these are gullible people ) as the people creating this environment of pro business propaganda. The extreme Leftists, in a way, are almost doing the right-wingers work for them, but going in entirely the opposite direction and taking the exact opposite extreme viewpoint, that you should absolutely always try to talk about controversial topics.

My suggestion, and what I try to put into practice, is only avoid things that are controversial to the vast majority of people: there are extremists that feel like calling food Chinese food, and saying you like to eat Chinese food is controversial. Again, these are toxic extremes, and saps all of the nuance out of the conversation, which is what most people want in their comics:

Nanced conversation about social issues. Sometimes the economic situation can effect what social situation comes about, but it is not a one for one. There are also a small extreme group that uses Politics to mean Social Issues, and not economic issues. Although I genuinely feel like even if I mentioned that politics could mean just about anything, these people would not acknowledge that.
