title: Webcomics Are Not The Same As Commercial Comics

I feel like my issues with US comics industry runs way deeper than some people with issues with the industry.

I'm also still figuring out whether half my issues stem from my issues with web comic communities, or if it's actually an issue with the larger industry honestly.

For example, for ebooks, there is a right way and a wrong way to format one. However, if a website is using #verticlescroll format, then why are they complaining when some people want right to left format?

Well for example, the concept of whether or not to include #digitalpayments, is not really something that would traditionally come up in the old mainstream comic industry. But it comes up all the time in web comics.

There are other specific issues like that unique to web comics.

Issues like whether or not to go #newsprint, or sell pamphlets at a mark up in a plastic case?

Yea that is an alien language to me. It never comes up in true webcomic. ( Not including ones formatted to be sold as pamphlets in comic book format. )

I really think Webcomics should be viewed as a seperate medium from traditional comics sometimes.

For those who remember, there was this one webcomic with infinite scroll in a horizontal direction.

This works well in web comic form, but it costs to much to print.

So for example, there could easily be a print comic and a web comic version that obeys the form constraints of either one of the same plot.

But calling a print comic scanned to be read on PC a webcomic, is kind of an insult to...webcomics. Exp. web to print.

When a web comic is formatted for print, that isn't because web and print are the same.

The artist is making a deliberate style decision to mimic print comics.
