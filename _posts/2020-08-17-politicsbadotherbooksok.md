title: Politics Bad, Fetish Books OK

I’m legitimately curious now, considering that the no politics line is basically used to mean “don’t talk politics that doesn’t align with my own”, I almost wonder what these people feel about legitimately pornographic sequential art. Which is ... arguably ... worse than having comics with a political leaning. Especially with Fetish comics that some people tend to create.

I have a number of different fetishes. Librarian in Birkenstocks is one fetish, spanked college girls is another fetish I have. Also robot girls as well. It almost seems like they would be more OK with people writing about that, than people writing dystopian fiction. ( Whether some fetish books would actually double as dystopian fiction is a whole other discussion ). But that rules out a lot of potential stories where politics, and people’s fetishes work together.

Books and comics set during the French Revolution come to mind. I wonder if any of these dude bros actually ever read manga like Rose Of Versailles. Which in the fetish world, is actually comparably tame. But it is heavily political in overtones; kind of a given if your book is about the fall of the French Royalty.

It completely eliminates the potential for Cyberpunk fiction specifically, where its entire point is basically its political overtones. Sure William Gibson is more of a centrist compared to people that call themselves “The Radical Left” today, although that’s a whole separate thing. But you can’t have Dark Science Fiction without it involving politics in some way.

Especially if your book is about Super-Powered dictators, and the woefully under powered people that fight oppression. But they would be more OK with producing books about people’s fetishes, than what someone’s political leaning is. As if somehow people’s fetishes were completely harmless.

What if I wrote a graphic novel script, about spanked college girls in Birkenstocks fighting the super powered dictator. I wonder if that would be seen as to political merely because it disagrees with them, but the fetish bits...ah years those parts completely fine.

Something is amiss here, and I'm beginning to doubt the narrative of people saying people's shouldn't be censored, when they advocate for a horrible fate for people that create books they disagree with.
