title: Why Advocating Intervention In IGG Campaigns Is A Form Of Fascism
published: true

Comicsgate has historically had people that would say things, like not wanting people to insert their own political opinions in Indiegogo campaigns. But there is a major problem here: they also claim to advocate for a legitimate Free Market dynamic, where anyone that can provide a service that people will buy, should be able to use the platform. Some of them even go so far as to advocate stalking people’s Twitter’s profiles to hunt for problematic elements in people vying to publish with them, thereby acting as an enforcer.

If I’m being honest, this sounds like exactly the same kind of thing they are accusing the far left. And here is why that is problem: by doing this, they are acting as an extension of the police force, an organization that is presently experiencing a lot of controversy at the moment. If they really advocated for a free market, then they would have no problem in LGBT or BIPOC people also used Indiegogo, and to promote their campaigns on social media.

See the main difference between a Free Market and Fascism is important. Yes, Leftists also blur the distinction between a Free Market economy and Fascism ( which is honestly kind of irresponsible ), but on the other hand there is something to be said by not allowing actual Fascists to ruin the dynamics of a free market. I personally advocate for a combined approach of Free Market dynamics, and Social Justice. The other problem, is actual Fascists are now bluring the lines a bit by advocating ( or claiming to ) social justice them self.

This is what publishers like Marvel and DC are doing, which historically have been the arch enemies of non mainstream comics groups like Underground Comix and Alternative Comic counter cultures.

When you say things like: do not insert your political views in your indiegogo, while also inserting your own political views on social media, what you are really saying is not to contradict your political views. In a sense, what you are advocating for is a kind of extreme government intervention in the Free Market. Which is even a part of the Free Market. The Right Wing idealogy that advocate for government intervention in the economy is typically considered a form of Fascism.

Notably, it Comics Perch that ( supposedly ) said in jest that he might actually advocate for Fascism, if it meant people would advocate for more superhero content in people’s comics. Fascism can be kind of a subtle thing. But one thing Fascism is not is a Free Market.

As someone pro Free Market, and Social Justice. If Comicsgate types were really for a Free Market, they would be for anyone of any political persuasion to attempt to brand themselves and create their own campaign, and be successful without them intervening in that person’s business, and being able to reach their own independent audience with their own brand identity.

This is why I’m Left Comicsgate.
