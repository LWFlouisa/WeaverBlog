title: Orientation And Economics Are Different Issues

In writing communities, I used to have the problem of people slapping labels on relationships with me. At one point it even went so far, as to assume I was “poly romantic”, even though the only thing I’ve ever been open about was not feeling like sex and love were necessarily connected. All this really means is that I might want to recieve a blowjob from four different pretty women, but I might only feel a romantic connection to one of these women. This really shouldn’t be that hard to understand, but for some reason a small portion of the radical left wants to make that an entirely separate orientation.

I consider myself extremely left-wing, far left even. And yet the extreme left is ruining their own argument, by connecting social liberalism with economic leftism, even those these two sections have absolutely nothing to do with each other. Even if one calls them self Libertarian Left ( and that is what I call myself ), that doesn’t mean I’m for abolishing gender and other kinds of nonsense. This is exclusively in the realm of Gender Studies, which is honestly an extremely small portion of left-wing thought, I’m not even sure why it is even given a platform on Anarcho-Communist talk shows.

What it ends up doing, is making it look like everyone who is further left-wing than Bernie Sanders, who is not anarcho-communist, basically right-wingers non necessarily. It’s already bad enough that conservatives already think that left-wing people don’t have nuanced opinions on issues, and think everyone that calls them self Socialist ( which I am, as that’s an economic viewpoint, not a social one ) is paramount to being Stalin / Lenin / Trotsky.

And so far there hasn’t not been any kind of satisfactory safe guards in places from having my left-wing culture basically derailed by people that genuinely do not understand economics. Even as someone like myself that agrees with Worker-Cooperatives, and worker ownership of production. But these extreme social-liberals, that haven’t a clue how the economy works, and look down on anyone with a more academic perspective, is making the situation worse. They’re giving right-wingers justification for their beliefs. Beliefs which should not even be viewed as justified in any way.

We on the economic left with Libertarian tendencies, need to distance ourselves from people on the left that overly focus on social issues, at the expense of understanding that it’s generally not a good idea to be disrupting the economy. This is one area, in ACTUAL mutualism, where I think they have it right. The problem is you have Anarcho-Communists infiltrating mutualism as well, and basically turning that into something it wasn’t intended to be.

If people wonder why I don’t discuss politics much, this is why. I would like to think I have some commonality with the Alt-Left, but even Kyle Kulynski has become absolutely fucking ridiculous these days. He’s only two years younger than myself, so you would think he would know better, but so far he’s been giving anarcho-communists a platform.

In essence, I consider myself someone who considers sex and romance to be separate. But I don’t necessarily want to assign myself a label for my sexuality, simply because that sexuality may be outside of the mainstream. That includes the fact that I also have a sexual preference for Robots girls. I have no interest in having my proclivities aped by class consciousness theory. These are entirely seperate topics, and never the two shall meet.

Why they feel orientation has to do with economics, I have no fucking idea. But it’s something that honestly has to stop. I’m not interested.
