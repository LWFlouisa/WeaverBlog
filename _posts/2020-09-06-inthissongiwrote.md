I now sing a hymn to no gods.
I instead hymn a new song.
I now sing a humn to no gods.

In this song I now wrote,
The rose buds are swaying to this new song.
The rose buds are swaying to this song.
In this song I now wrote,

I now sing a hymn to no gods.
I instead hymn a new song.
I now sing a humn to no gods.
I sing this song.
