title: How Is MangaExit different from Comicsgate?
published: true

MangaExit is a reaction to an increasingly right-wing direction Comicsgate has taken, despite them starting with a more libertarian leaning. Think of this as the left-wing answer to Comicsgate, but unlike Comicsgate does not entirely hate every single mainstream comics publisher.

MangaExit is closer to an educational resource for learning Japanese, crucial for later education about the history of manga, and getting published in Japan as a comics creator. Most of the issues with lack of access in manga stems from people not having the resources to learn Japanese. To make matters worse, most language learning centers also primarily teach Romance languages, and some German languages. While this happens to benefit myself as a Conlang creator, it doesn’t help me in trying to be published in Japan.

The other difference, is that the individual expertise of each creator is explicitly encouraged. If you have background as a Politician, bring that knowledge to your work. If you background as a teacher, use that to influence your comics. I happen to have background as an AI developer, and wish to eventually start my own developmental firm on the one of the next generations of humanoid robots. Purely talking about comics is limiting, because it means all you can really talk about is the craft  of comics.

A note on diversity, this is neither a pro or anti-diversity group. The main goal is to unite the working class, particularly non-Japanese people, in forming a union structure to counter the growing resistance to foreign creators in overseas countries like Japan, China, Thailand, and the Philippines. However the best approach for doing this is becoming part of those respectful cultures, and learning about those cultures.

First I will learn about Manga-Specific Japanese, Chinese, Thai, and Philipino words. Eventually I will expand this portion to learning those languages more broadly. I will also include going into the different art styles of comics in each respective culture, and how it influences foreign creators. This will also go a bit into my personal experience with Tokyopop, and how it has effected the reading style of generations after myself.

Eventually I may line up some guests in the Indie Manga industry, generally those from Arthouse publishers.

Note that while MangaExit does not view DC and Marvel in the same way as Comicsgate does, it also does not approve with misrepresenting trans issues, and therefore some episodes will be devoted to explaining what actual trans issues are. It is also important to remember that being an indie creator doesn’t mean that you are part of a hate group.
