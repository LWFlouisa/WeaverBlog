title: Visualizing Hyper Directions For Comics

We have standard three dimensional directions. In a game this can be thought of as backwards, forwards, aside left and right, above, and below. A hyper direction can be thought of then as seeing each direction at the same time. Thus several new hyper directions can be conceived:

(1. Hyper-Directional Forward
(2. Hyper-Directional Backward
(3. Hyper-Directional Aside Left
(4. Hyper-Directional Aside Right
(5. Hyper-Directional Above.
(6. Hyper-directional Below.

In order to best depict this on a two dimensional surface, you need to come up with the concept of a “Hyper Panel”--a panel that depict all non hyper directions at the same time. Then you would visually depict time progressing, by having a 2 by 4 grid or 4 by 2 grid ( tall or wide ) grid. Each hyper panel must depict hyper-directional forward, backward, aside left or right, above, and below.

A hyper-directional, can thus be thought of as visualizing every direction at once, sort of like how a fly sees the world. Or having lots of mirrors in your car.

The tricky part is thing figure out the different vanishing points displayed at the same time, based on how the objects are displays on a standard three dimensional surface. Sort of like how we look at mechanical drawings of cities. And seeing every possible direction such objects would be in. Thus an object can be visually on hyper-panel’s right in one standard panel.

A good example of a hyper panel, can be compared to a standard comic book page. But each panel can be thought of as depicting a three directional space. We see this in movies by scene breaks.

So going to work on how to visualize efficiently a hyper-panel.
