title: How Critical Race Theory Hurts Publishing
published: true

One of the ultimate effects of critical race theory, even if one isn’t very well studied on the academic jargon, is how it negatively effects people chances of being published in whatever arena you desire, and equally compete for gaining recognition for artistic achievement. We see this with Wokism recently being slapped onto the Oscar Awards as a requirement for people winning it, but it effects the larger publishing industry, especially independant creators.

Where I differ from Comicsgate is to me CG doesn’t really both to really attack Wokism, because their entire framework is based around rolling back the comic industry 20 or 30 years. In a sense it is replacing censorship with censorship in entirely the opposite direction. I want to have an equal chance of being published in Japan as any native Japanese creator.

The problem with Critical Race Theory is they have completely dropped pretending to really be after equal opportunity: “Comic History Studies” lady on this one channel even goes so far as to claim that wanting to produce “manga” is Appropriative. It should be obvious to anyone with a brain, that the end result of such claims is not equal opportunity in getting published in other countries, but rather the exact opposite in practice.

In effect, what Critical Race Theorists really want is for American comic creators to only be published in America, where such creators are bound to the publishing dictates set forth by Critical Race Theory. In a sense, SJWs are equally invested in keeping the working class down in the publishing world as supposed “extreme right wingers”.

To me both the Alt-Right and Critical Race Theorists work together to try to censor creators from being able to tell the stories they want to tell. The only difference is Critical Race Theorists want to pretend to be about diversity, for purpose of fooling the people not aware of the bigotry that underlies the system of Critical Race and Gender Theory. It is no solution, then, to replace Critical Race Theory with criquing anyone who wants to dispense with American Superheroes, as somehow trying to “force politics” down readers throats. In fact, if anyone is proficient at forcing politics in people’s faces, it is in fact the Alt-Right and Critical Race Theorists, who have more in common than some might like to believe.
