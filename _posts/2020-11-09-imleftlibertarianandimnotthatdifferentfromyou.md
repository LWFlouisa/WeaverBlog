title: I’m Left Libertarian, And I’m Not That Different From You
published: true

The entire reason I went left ( otherwise I would have stayed Libertarian...ish ) is doing to having extreme concerns about how far right the right was becoming, and an increasing amount of concerns about judicial errors: specifically how likely it is that someone sentenced to death was convicted incorrectly, and the morality whether or not mentally ill people should get the needle. There were also some economic issues I had concerns about.

I had no idea the radical left would somehow think it was acceptable to engage in mob justice, and other nonsense. Stuff like this was not where I gravited to left-wing values. What is important are economic concerns. What is important is the fact that pollution is contributing to Climate Change, and still has not been properly addressed, except by Green Fascism.

What is not important: the status of people’s physical relationships, dining, and attempting to cancel authors whom I have not even cared about sense I was in high school. I don’t care that these authors said something nasty on social media. And the thing is when they do this nonsense, they make the left look absolutely insane. I’m tired of having to apologies to right-wingers because a certain portion of the left is in fact genuinely insane. We’ve left the far left drive the narrative about what being left wing is all about.

I’m not even including Comicsgate in this equation. We have a problem in this country that has been kicking up steam and misappropriating left-wing values for a cause that is not even progressive in values. It is not even left-wing, when it comes right down to it. It’s the most conservative theory out there.

Stuff like this was not why I went left. I went left because I had serious moral issues about capital punishment and other forms of judicial injustice. I also believe in worker cooperatives, and universal dividends. But the far left would probably wrap these around Critical Theories, and then consume these otherwise brilliant theories from within. I literally have to say nothing around right-wingers, because I can’t afford to even give away that I’m left-wing these days, because to half the country they think that means “Cancel Culture” mafia.

No, Left Libertarians are not that different from you, we’re just a little bit better about issues like Capital Punishment, Climate Change, Public Housing Crises, and other social services. We’re probably also against torture. Most of us on the left have about as much disinterest in Cancel Culture as you do. We just try to communicate our dissatisfaction in a more honest way.
