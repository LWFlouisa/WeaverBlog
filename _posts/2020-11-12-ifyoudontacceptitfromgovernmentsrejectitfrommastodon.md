title: If Don't Accept It From Governments, Don't Accept It From Mastodon

I feel like certain statements about Mastodon are honestly extreme understatements. [Mastodon Police State](https://gameliberty.club/@realcaseyrollins/104436295732520467)

We would never except such behaviour if it were our government, yet for whatever reason people blindly accept such behaviours, simply because it's not a government entity that runs their social media in this manner.

Could you imagine, living in a government, where you had to be 100% careful about what you say at all times, or else you're be hunted and persecuted, because you said one thing that wasn't 100% acceptable?

If we don't accept it from our governments, we shouldn't also accept it from nominal anarchists / libertarians, who don't even believe in anarchist / libertarian principles have the time.

If you're lodging accusations at people for misperceived slights, you're the source of the problem. Not the people you're making the accusation.

But this is part of the hypocracy of Mastodon, they seem blissfully unaware of the fact that they are a private organization in and of themselves, and most Left Libertarians think private organizations should be regulated. They should not get a free pass on this just because they claim to just not be a for profit enterprise. Governments regulate non profits as well. Whether you make a profit on something should make no difference. Governments regulate other government entities at times.

Do not claim to be this paragon of Leftist values, when you enjoy the benefits of being a private enterprise.
