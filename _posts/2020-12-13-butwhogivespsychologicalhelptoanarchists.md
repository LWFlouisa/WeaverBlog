title: But Who Gives Psychological Help To Anarchists?

There are thus of us who still consider ourselves leftist, but dislike the general trajectory dogmatic leftism has gone. While it is easy to think one is the only one that experiences these issues, the reality is probably this is more common than you might think. Of increasing concern is how Leftism has eroded institutions like psychological therapy, necessary for those who have developed psychological conditions both before and after getting involved with anarchist circles.

What I don’t often discuss, is how I was experiencing a lot of emotional issues in Washington, do to my ex room mate engaging in all sorts of psychological abuse on me. Long story short, I eventually ended up attempting suicide three different times at that point. There are people that actually really need psychological help, that are instead getting involved in Anarchist circles, as a misguided coping mechanism to help them with their problems.

And yet, by nature of being involved with anarchists, one must deal with the reality that they may be psychologically unprepared to admit themselves they need psychological cult. This is actually common in cult groups, but less common in political circles outside of an idealogy. Part of me had to let go of the idea that the left represented human compassion, and more often than not demonstrate attributes of being completely the opposite of this.

I say I more identity with ( not to be confused with “identify as”, that’s a term unique to trans people ) C4SS, but even they are increasingly being dominated by people that are derailing the original goals of the organization. This puts people in a weird sport who would otherwise be Libertarian Leftists, who identity with Libertarianism, who no longer have an organization that they recognize. But don’t want to be associated with the culture of Cancel Culture that has been sweeping the online left.

I came to the left, because I oppose capital punishment. I oppose aspects of human cruelty, and find it perturbing how the left has went from an organization that opposed things like capital punishment, to one that borders on advocating for it for oligarchs, which as history has shown, never just stops at oligarchs. For people like us, there may not be therapists who treat our situation.

So who will treat these cult survivors?
