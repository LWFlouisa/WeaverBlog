title: It Is Impossible To Be Seen As A Normal Trans Woman

Trans women and men are normal people, like every other men and women. We are not inventing new gender pronouns to prove our oppression status. I feel honestly betrayed by trans support groups, because what I associate with them now is the larger LGBT mythology invented out of whole cloth, by ideological extremists, that do not represent the best interests of trans people.

My lifelong goal had been to become a science fiction and fantasy writer, and to produce graphic novels. If my main character was transgendered, this meant pretty much what being transgendered has always meant: it means going to see a gender therapist, taking hormones for a certain period of time, and then having the necessary surgeries to complete your transition. But it has come to be used in ways that don’t even represent trans issues.

Just because I am a trans woman, does not mean that every time I create a trans character I want to depict them as having a persecution complex, and inventing new pronouns to satisfy this narcissistic tendency. You have the extreme left that are literally making us look like nothing else, and not being held accountable for this behavior.

You have Right-Wingers, that take this narrative and completely run with it, by constantly rebranding their own channels to fit within different narratives to perpetuate a culture war with the left. But an extremely important thing seems to be lost in this discussion: neither side represents the best interest of trans men and women.

Trans women / men, in almost all cases, simply want to be left alone to live their lives. Not be forced into different political idealogies, especially authoritarian ones. And now, with Anarcho-Communism becoming increasingly an oxy-moron at this point, you have places like Chaz / Chop literally taking us along for that specific joy ride. A ride where you have absolute nut jobs thinking it’s ok to lecture people about mask wearing, while literally exposing yourself in public to fullfill some kind of oppression quota.

I don’t think that most trans support groups tolerate such political extremism, but I honestly have no idea. But there should be a new rule in trans support groups: this is not a group for preaching a political idealogy, whether that is trans medicalism or trans abolitionism. Lesbians that want to debunk trans issues? Doesn’t belong in a trans support group. Lesbians who aren’t trans should not be leading any trans support group. Anarcho-communists that want to dismantle the system? Again, has no place in a trans support group.

The transgendered community needs to start enforcing these boundaries, as we have literally non trans people driving the public narrative about trans issues, and making it impossible to be seen as a normal Scifi and Fantasy writer, despite being a trans woman.
