The space travel trip began with Catherine Howard, the long 
descendant of the original fated queen's family, going to the 
spaceship's CGI room to play out her previous experience with near 
beheading. She knelt at the headsman's block, waiting for the ax to 
drop. It was determined a long time ago that as the closest living 
relative after a thousand years after the fall of the British royalty, 
that she would be the one to do the honors, and rule the miniature 
starship.

 

I went into the travel room, walked across the 
neon hall, and stepped on the teleporter into the ship. Warping into the
 Captain's Room, they escorted me to the room where the queen would lose
 her head. They want to constantly be reminded of my treason in order to
 make me feel guilt. Having various planets we needed to go, I would be 
undergoing this shame for a while. To some it sure wins over being shot,
 but depends on who you talk to. I had a kind of resentment toward 
Catherine, even if she couldn't help being related to the queen.

Her
 body guards were not half bad looking, although one eye-balling me like
 he was somewhat attracted made it uncomfortable. With long curly bright
 blond hair, she serves as a contrast to my curly brown locks. She wore 
Jesus sandals without socks. Her chest, in comparison to mine, were a 
delightful medium b size, where I barely more than a stub. Apparently 
the guard liked tiny chests.

"So how about we start acting for a 
new world, instead of acting for the tough crowd on this planet, fuck 
the shit up of that children's program we used to act in." We used to 
act as character in a children's program, before they found out 
Catherine was descended from the British queen. Instead as someone 
wearing black boots, ladies long underwear (black), and no shirt on do 
to the slightly warmer weather (the queen likes things hot), they looked
 at me as if mildly wanting to squeeze my tits.

Even as Catherine laughed at my joke, she wanted nothing to do with me. Not since I tried to behead her for real once.

Just you wait Catherine.

 

We
 landed on a once jungle planet, the boys took their space Katanas with 
them. I merely carried pepper spray to defend myself as Catherine could 
no longer trust me carrying a Katana. I was the slave who would perform 
tasks on the ship until they came back or called for me. "Stay here 
pepper spray girl."

I don't remember how many times I was paddled 
by the lead guard at the order of the queen. There seemed to be 
something beyond merely the punishment itself that made her junk puff 
up. I knew this as the position I was in the direction always had me in 
the clear view of her pink taco on those nights, but thankfully there 
was no spankings tonight. It was getting late on this planet. Catherine I
 knew wanted to have a conversation with me, as she seemed to become 
less distant over the last few weeks. At times I would see big bright 
red puffy cheeks.

 

At camp Catherine spent half her time 
eating, and the rest giving head to the two guard boys who she payed 
using blowjobs. She also loved big white fluffy marshmallows she used to
 eat in grade school. She saw that I stood outside, and snuck up behind 
me. I half expected her to stab me in the back. Instead she simply 
stared at me while I avoided her eyes staring into the empty abyss of 
the mountain side. "I can understand the frustration as someone I used 
to date. Honestly if I were you I would have decapitated myself as 
well."

"How would that even work." I asked.

"OK well someone else would be queen."

"Nice
 try Catherine, means so much." I had to restrain a cackle, picturing 
her take a space Katana, and slitting her throat till her head 
eventually rolled along the deck of the Captain's quarters. "Only you 
can be the queen."

Like I said, we once acted in an 
intergalactic acting troop for kids. A far cry for the friendliness for 
children's, I fell a long ways to get to this point. My inner child 
gradually starving out by the year. We were taken off the air to do a 
settlement dispute for using the royal families bloodline without 
permission. It eventually concluded with me becoming the secret sex 
slave of Catherine, although she never told the guards this. My 
understanding is she was unsure how the bloodline would feel with her 
own treason. That maybe she would be beheaded.

I thought beheading her would be a mercy kill.

I suppose it wasn't.

 

Now
 we go our separate ways on the ship leaving the once jungle planet. I 
dream about tap dancing girls and caned fairies. I wanted to rewrite the
 stage play of my entire life. I dream of Catherine's ancestor's neck 
chopped through by an ax, her head gradually tumbling into the abyss of 
the basket, blood dropping quickly. She knows me to well, using 
beheading rituals to get me to cave.

It's irritating mostly.

We
 met with new producers in the next world that wanted to interview the 
traitors not executed. I had nothing else to say to them.
